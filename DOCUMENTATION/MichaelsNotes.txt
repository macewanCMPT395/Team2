Feb.20:
	Since all of our team members are preoccupied with other class material and course work, 
	as well as the first sprint being dominated by midterms, our plans during reading week have fallen apart.

	We are disorganized but are making progress in understanding Ushahidi's codebase.  No implementation has
	been decided on as we all work independently trying things out.  Our highest priority goal still is to 
	make the association explicitly defined the a User hiearchy (ie Superadmin-Admin-Member) which is already
	implemented (may not be want we want though).
		    
	Reading week has turned into experimentation and understanding PHP and Ushahidi's codebase, meaning all the
	implementation stories for this week must be pushed to the next sprint.

	Although very undesirable, it is expected as out focus factor is very very low due to heavy course and project
	work in 3 - 4 other classes for all team members (not to mention external responsibities).
	     
	This will be a reoccuring trend of pushing back main stories, but it is still likely we will have a stable
	impelementation or at least prototype by the end of the term.
Feb.23:
	Did a bunch of Kohana tutorials to get a better understanding of the framework.  Most helpful was:
	http://dev.kohanaframework.org/projects/kohana2/wiki/Kohana101

	Note: view for Submit a New Report page is "/Team2/themes/default/views/reports/submit.php"
Feb.24:
	Built a simple PHP controller and view for a possible georole creation page, submit button links to the submit
	page on the Ushahidi instance 
	
	***NOTE: cant seem to get stylesheet to work correctly inside any view created.
	Seems kohana framework re-routes the link from /~jharvard/kohana/index.php/..." to just "/kohana/index.php/..."
Feb.25:
	Had a quick team meeting in during the CMPT 395 Lab, discussed where we are in terms of understanding the code base
	and it seems we are still heavily confused.  We are behind alot in terms of what we set out to plan.  All team members
	have done some kohana and php tutorials to gain a better understanding.  Agreed upon focusing on the first and most
	important user story which is implementing the 'User Hiearchy'.  

	Other members have other projects they ahd to work on so no further work was completed in the lab.

	***gained better understanind go CSS stylesheet and how php works with HTML***
	***created mockup CreateGeorole webpage in admin dashboard***
Mar.3:
	NOTE: to modify the general layout of an interface, need to modify the particular interfaces
	"layout.php" file (ex. views/admin/layout.php)
	
	Added code to admin/layout.php on line 235 to test georole.css
Mar.4
	GEOMETRY layout from submit report page found in "themes/default/views/reports/submit.php"
	GEOMETRY values from submit report page found in the $form[] array object on line 256
	of "application/controllers/reports.php"
	
	$geometries object found in ./default/views/reports/submit_edit_js.php

	*****drawCircle() function located at line 110 in views/map_common_js	
	*****drawCircle function used in /themes/default/views/reports/reports_js.php


*	To edit anything in any UI, you need to find the applicable .php file in
	/applications/helpers and then add a string reference in the appropreiate
	library file in /applications/i18n/en_US/ (ex. ui_admin.php)
		
	***all text names for all gui objects are dynamically named this way

Mar.5
	*** We have divided the tasks among our group members to, at this level:

	Michae = read in a georole designated by a name and assign it to the user(is admin level, controler)

	Taylor = when a user tries to submit a report, it validates that it the area is within their georole (just by
	comparing if their georole is the same as the city in which they are in)

	Stephen = and all the backend database work

	***NOTE georoles at this point will just be string values designatinh cities

	Michael: -to add georole proerty, need to modify User_Model in application/models/user
	         -added column in database (under users) for georole
		 -Need to modify create_user() function definition (add georole) in application/models/user.php
		 -Need to modify create_user() function call in /modules/auth/libraries/drivers/Auth/ORM.php (line 256)
		 -Need to modify create_user() function call in /application/controllers/login.php (line 255)
		 (DONT KNOW FULL IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGES)
		 
		 ***successfully adds georole as string to user table in database from /admin/users/edit/

Mar.8
    
     Michael: created two new files to test including a map:
        - applications/controllers/tests/georolemap.php
        - applications/views/tests/georole_map.php
        
     included code from:
        - applications/controllers/admin/reports.php in function edit() starting at line 316
        - applications/views/admin/reports/edit.php on line 203 to 234
        
     ***NOTE: GEOMETRY object in geometry table in database is made up of an SQL GEOMETRY Object
              (ie contains POINT values)
              
             * "geometry" variable used in reports.php is made up of an array of values (one for each
              unique row in the geometry table), and is part of a "form" object *
             

Mar. 10

     No luck with decyphering how graphical geometry control works on applications/views/admin/reports/edit.php 
     page....

     ***However, will try to add a "custom GeoRole Filter" by modifying:
     applications/controllers/reports.php
     themes/default/views/reports/main.php starting at line 182

     Will be working on this in class to more, as well as to make a controller parse a logged in users
     georole data, automatically put it into this filter, and restrict list of reports to that location/locations

Mar. 11:
     
     *** Report Submission validaiton working with added georole attribute to user model
     	 (city must be within users assigned georole before they can submit a report)

 	 Michael: gonna change themes/default/view/reports/list.php to edit view of report list,
 	          and application/controllers/reports.php (edit function called on line 167,
 	          fetch_incidents function located in helpers/reports.php,
 	          might need to modify models/incidents.php to make change for fetch_incidents
 	          
 	          
 	          ***Modifying incident.php at line 310 to add to the SQL query, if done right should
 	             reduce incidents or reports returned to the list, also modified reports.php at roughly
 	             line 1000 to include georole value when passing to fetch_incidents and get_incident functions
 	             needed to form query
 	             
 	             No Success so far
Mar. 13/14:

    Michael:  ***changes to helpers/reports.php and models/incidents.php files implicitly restrict the list
              of reports to only incidents reported from a location that corresponds to a users georole, even if
              filtered by other fields (ie if choose all categories, still reduces the list)
              
              ***if georole is null, doesnt add line to query so it includes all incidents in list view
              (default behavior if georole is null is that all reports still added to list in views/reports.php)
              FIXED
              
              ***Still need to implement to parse georole and location to match in sql query if georole made of
              multiple cities
              FIXED
              
              ***Adding title to reports view page to tell user limiting report list ot ehir georole
                    -modified themes/default/views/reports/main.php on line 11
                    -modified applicaiton/il8n/en_US/ui_main.php on line 196              
                    -modified themes/default/css/style.css at end of file
Mar.15:
                 
     Function Created:               
              *modified _get_report_listing_view() function in /controllers/reports.php to
               recalculate $stats_breadcrumb used in report list view to list how many reports are in the list
                    -did this by making the function georole_report_count() in the same file (line starting at 206, and
                    function at end of file)
              *fixed georole header message in themes/default/views/reports/main.php to not display is georole is null
                    
Mar. 17:
    
    ***implemented function to filter "markers" baseon georole before being rendered as geojson objects.***
    ***right now, only renders incidents that are outside a users georole as black dots***
       (NOTE: will changed behavior later to not make incidents clickable by the user)
    
        * - modified applications/controllers/json.php at line 133
        
    Function Created: in applications/controllers/json.php called filter_markers() at end of file
    
    **fixed and cleaned up code created previously in applications/models/incidents.php at line 312
      by abstracting code into a function, and removed uneccessary code in applications/helpers/reports.php at end of file
      
    Function Created: in applications/models/incidents.php called filter_georole_list() at end of file
    
    ***Still need to fix:
        -how clustering is done for markers on the map now as filtering by georole still doesnt affect the normal clusters
         (ie a cluster of 3 markers that are filtered are still count 3 red even though one is black)
        -on reports page, some number values as the dont implicitly change with the report list
        
Mar. 18: (STEVE LIND IS WRITING THIS)
    -Editing this file to test github as we are having major issues with git.
        
    Michael:
        Fixed: 
            - issue with cluttering (editted applications/controllers/json.php by making function to remove markers)
            - fixed report list issue (eddited applications/models/incidents.php and modified function at end
                to use query that splits and lower cases l.location_name)

Mar. 19:(Steve Lind)
     -Editing this file in order to clean github
                
Mar. 20:
    Michael: created new local branch called "michael", will be working on that
            *trying to edit report content-block on main map page by filtering by georole
            *need to modify:
                -themes/default/views/blocks/main_reports.php
                -applications/il8n/en_Us/ui_main.php
                -and possibly applications/helpers/blocks.php
                
            ***modified:
                -applications/il8n/en_Us/ui_main.php at line 197 (added georole_reports_listed)        
                -themes/default/views/blocks/main_reports.php
                    -lines 2-7 to accomidate new report_listed title that includes user georole and name
                    -lines 23-26 function call to filter $incidents array based on reports within georole
                    
            Function created:
                -added function filter_incidents() to applications/helpers/blocks.php that takes a georole and
                and incident array and filters the incidents to contain only those within the georole
                
            *Figured out that line 256 in applications/controllers/login.php causing runtime error when generating
            new user (as required georole)
            
            
Mar. 22:
    Michael:
        -modified /applications/controllers/reports.php at line 470 to redirect the page
        if a specified incident, that is selected to have its details viewed, are outside a users georole
        
        ***Need to look to /themes/views/reports/submit.php line 20 to get how the red error box
        works for the submit page and how to incorporate it into the main page
        ***and helpers/report.php at line 38 to get how the error is generated
        ***and il8n/en_US/reports.php  for georole how to see where the error messagesare
        
        ***Modified:
            -/themes/default/views/main/layout.php at line 12 to add conditional to show a red error
            box if current page is the georole_error.php page that copies the main pages session
            
        ***File created: georole_error.php is an exact copy of the Main_Controller class in applications (applicaitons/main.php),
           except for it displays an error message when a users page is redirected by the due to accessing a georole outside
           of their georole  

Mar. 29:
    Michael: need to still modify the reports list as has some faults even though reports are filtered
        Need to:
            -change the number of pages listed, and the prev and next page buttons to work with the filtered list
            (in controllers/reports.php in _get_reports_listing function,  in helpers/reports.php where $pagination
            object set)
            
           
        ***Modified:
            - helper/reports.php starting at line 970 to accomidate georole to change $pagination and the navigational
              bar above the reports list  
            - moved count_incidents_in_georole() function from controllers/reports.php to helpers/reports.php so i can be used outside
              of the controller,
            * removed stat_breadcrumb changed mentioned a few days ago from controllers/reports.php starting at line 195
              as changes to helpers now implements what the removed code did.
             
             
              
Apr. 3:
    Michael: editing the files
        - /controllers/admin/users.php
        - /views/admin/users/edit.php
        - /helpers/admin.php
        
        so an admin cannot edit a user outside their georole, cannot modify their own georole
        or the georole of others, and restrict from modifying the superadmin

Apr.4:
    Michael:
        - edited /i18n/en_US/ui_admin.php at line 95 to add error messages for admin's trying to edit
          accounts the shouldn't
        - edited /applications/views/admin/users/edit.php at line 20 to display error message if flags are set
        - edited and add functions to applications/helpers/admin.php at line 309 to compare georoles and to
          perform checks on the flag (including references the database)
        * edited /controllers/admin/users.php for the function edit() starting at line 85 to incorporate error
          flags for different conditions, if there set then the changes to the form is never propagated to the DB
         ***SUCCESS***
         
          
Apr.5:
    Michael: introducing authenticaiton when no user is logged in (so the website doesn't crash) introduced a bunch of 
            errors among edited files (due to variables not be defined out of conditionals so if no user logged in, variables
            dont get values).
            
                * fixed /themes/default/views/reports/list.php at line 26 and 165 (no need to authenticate $stats_breadcrumb)
                * fixed applications/controllers/reports.php at line 212 (else statement to set default $stats_breadcrumb value)
                * fixed /applications/helpers/reports.php at the EOF (made function count all roles if georole is NULLfor SUPERADMIN
                    or no logged in)
                
        **** BIG PROBLEM: reports page not found if the user has a georole (not NULL)
        
Apr.6:
    Michael: need to implicitly filter user lsit under admin dashboard to only users within an admins georole
            (ie cant see anything outside georole or other administrators)
            
            
            *** modified:
                -/applicaitons/controllers/admin/user.php at line 71 to filter the user objects by the current users georole using a function
                -/applications/helpers/admin.php added function filter_users_on_georole() at line 305 to filter the users object
                ^might not have to modify these files
